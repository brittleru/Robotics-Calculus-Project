# Robotics-Calculus-Project

### Brief
This is a project I had in the fourth year of University, the coordinator was Conf. Dr. Ing. Bogdan Gramescu. You can check the full project in the <code>.word</code> file attached here. The project was about designing a mechanical hand from scratch, for some specific data and functionality, for that I had to use calculus in order to get the exact parameters for the perfect design. The calculus was implemented in JavaScript and I used HTML and CSS to create an interface for the user to make this calculus universal and autonomous. I used local host to remember the initial data.
